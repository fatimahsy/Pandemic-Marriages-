write me a 4 sentence abstract for a paper that investigates marriage licenses in Toronto before and after the pandemic. More specifically, a good recipe for an abstract is: first sentence: specify the general area of the paper and encourage the reader; second sentence: specify the dataset and methods at a general level; third sentence: specify the headline result; and a fourth sentence about implications.

This paper examines trends in marriage licenses in Toronto, focusing on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on marital patterns. Using a dataset of marriage license registrations from 2015-2023, we apply time series analysis and statistical comparisons to investigate shifts in marriage rates before, during, and after the pandemic. Our findings show a significant decline in licenses issued during the pandemic, followed by a sharp increase in the post-pandemic period. These results suggest that social disruptions caused by the pandemic have had lasting effects on marriage trends, potentially influencing future policy and service planning.
